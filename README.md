Test repository for your notebooks on machine learning.

To run these on your own laptop, we strongly recommend installing Python 3 with anaconda. This is the easiest way to install the various non-standard packages you'll need to run machine learning algorithms.

If you don't want to use anaconda or Python 3, you can use pip to install the necessary packages. If using Python 2.7, it is your responsibility to make sure that your notebooks are compatible with Python 3.
